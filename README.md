# The Music and the Math
## Mathematical Models Behind the Basic Scales and Chords

This is a final project for the course “Math concepts for developers”, part of the AI module in SoftUni (https://softuni.bg). It is trying to present the basics of the main principles concerning the relationship between music and mathematics. It is a descriptive work which main focus is on the frequency characteristic of the notes, scales and chords and the relations between them.  
The Introduction part deals with the base concepts, discussed in more detail in the next two chapters - Synusoid analysis and Music and perception. The application of the theoretical models is presented in the chapters Scales and Chords.  
The paper does not claim to be exhaustive, its purpose is to propose some algorithms that would be suitable for describing and presenting the considered phenomena.
